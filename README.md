# Internal-workorder
This is a GUI based web application that will be used to fulfill all software and hardware service requests for full time and part time staff at George Mason University. Any staff member, whether new or exiting, can request the necessary services using this GUI. Services will fall into different categories: hardware, software, phone service, and repair (other categories might be added depending on future assignments). A request can contain orders from the different categories. Requests can be saved, modified and deleted. Through the web application, a user can see the previous requests made and their status. The status will change based on predetermined fulfillment times (example: 1 day for software, 3 for hardware, etc â€¦). The web application is also used to off board/terminate staff if he/she decides to leave George Mason University. On off boarding, all his privileges will be revoked and his account will be deactivated. The goal will be to make an easy to use, functional, and robust user interface.
